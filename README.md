CS5321 Intro to Databases Practicum

• Developed a recursive descent parser to convert mathematical expressions to a tree representation (infix, prefix and postfix)
• Coded the logic to walk through the infix representation of the tree and evaluate the expression using stacks
• Implemented the visitor pattern to convert the tree to a linked list in prefix/postfix and evaluated the value of the expression
